					<u>This is a header that is big and underlined.</u>

					<i>This is a paragraph that is Arial, grey, and italicized.</i>

					This is additional writing per the assignment on step 151 of the HTML and CSS Course. Anything in a "p" tag should be grey, centralized and Arial. per assignemnet on step 154 this code should now appear this way due it linking to an external CSS stylesheet rather than html metadata in the same file.
