			<h1>Poem</h1>
			<p>
				All that is <span style="color: gold; font-weight: bold; background-color: grey;">gold does not glitter.</span><br>
				Not all those who wander are lost.<br>
				The old that is strong does not wither.<br>
				Deep roots are not <span style="color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; background-color: steelblue;">reached by the frost.</span><br>
				From the ashes a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; background-color: khaki;">fire shall be woken.</span><br>
				A light from the <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red; font-size: xx-large;">shadow</span> shall spring.<br>
				Renewed shall be blade that was broken.<br>
				The crownless again shall be king.
