		<h1>Gibraltar, Wattson, and Pathfinder</h1>
			<p>
				<h3>Gibraltar</h3> He is a tank and is my favorite to use due to his gun shield and team utility.
				<h3>Wattson</h3> She is good for defending and holding a strategic point on the map with her electric fences.
				<h3>Pathfinder</h3> They are my favorite to play aggresive with as their grapple can get you into and out of the fight quickly.
